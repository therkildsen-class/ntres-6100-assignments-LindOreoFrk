ChatGPT 5.0

2.  Prompt(s): paste exact prompt(s) used

Why question 1.1 and 1.2 are comparing vectorization vs.Â loop?

3.  AI output summary: brief summary, not full text

It compares 2 approaches on output, code writing style, runtime, and
suitable situation.

It also explains the reason why these two are put together to be
compared with each other: for us to see the coding logic behind
different approaches and to understand that different approaches could
be utilized under different conditions. And later in exercise 2 we had
an example of using loop on automatically running files with only the
year being different.

4.  Edits made and rationale: what was changed, why, and what was
    learned

This prompt did not involve any revision made on code.

5.  Verification: how correctness was checked (unit tests, small
    examples, benchmarks)

No correctness involved.
